Graph Traversal

1. BFS : Breadth-First-Search
2. DFS : Depth-First-Search

# It is very likely that you reach at the same node again.

DFS(u, adj, vis) : [visited array, adjacent nodes, start point] | 
    -> if vis : return 
    -> vis[u] = True
    -> for each adjacent neighbour -> call dfs recursively


BFS() : [visited array, adjacent nodes, queue, start point] | [ Shortest Paths ]
    -> while queue
        -> pop 
        -> measure
        -> enque

# Cycle-Detection In a Graph [ Directed & Undirected ]
    -> Undirected : 
        -> DFS :  [ Pass current node as parent node of next node, if you find out that the next node is already visited and it is not the parent ] -> [ vis, parent, adj, src ]
        -> BFS :  [ ]
