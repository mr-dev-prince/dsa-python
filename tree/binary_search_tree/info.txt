-> Binary Search Tree -> max two child nodes for each nodes
    -> left node : always lesser than parent node
    -> right node : always greater than parent node

Operations:
    -> Search - O(height)
    -> Insertion - O(height)
    -> Deletion - O(height)

Details :
    -> Inorder Traversal is always sorted
    -> 

Deletion:
    -> if root is None return root
    -> if key < curr.val -> 
    -> elif key > curr.val ->
    -> if key == curr.val -> 

AVL: Adelson-Velsky & Landis
    -> self balancing binary search Tree
