Tree -> Non-Linear Hierachical Data Structure | consists nodes connected by edges

-> Operations : Traversal [ Preorder, Postorder, Inorder ], Insertion, Deletion

-> Components
    -> Node - contains a key or value and pointer to child nodes
    -> edges - connecting link between two nodes
    -> height - 
    -> depth -

-> Properties :
    -> There should never be a cycle
    -> All Nodes should be connected
    -> [ N ] Nodes -> [ N - 1 ] edges

-> Binary Tree - Every node have atmost two [ left, right ] nodes and atleast 0 nodes
    -> Full Binary Tree -> either two child nodes or none
    -> Perfect Binary Tree -> all leaf nodes are at same level | all internal nodes have two child nodes
    -> Complete Binary Tree -> Any level should not have a gap in between [ Heaps are complete binary tree ]
    -> Degenerate Binary Tree -> Zig Zag child nodes [0 or 1 node for each node]
    -> Skewed Binary Tree -> A tree having only left or only right childs [ 0 or 1 nodes for each node ]
    -> Balanced Binary Tree -> abs | height(left) - height(right) | = 0

-> Traversals 
    -> Pre-Order Traversal - [ Root -> Left -> Right ]
    -> Post-Order Traversal - [ Left -> Right -> Root ]
    -> In-Order Traversal - [ Left -> Root -> Right ]
    -> Level-Order Traversal -> Level-By-Level
